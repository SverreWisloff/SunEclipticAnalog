# Sun Ecliptic Analog Watchface

[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)

## Purpose

*The goal of this project is to create an analog watchface that displays the sun's path on the sky*

This simple analog round wathcface shows the sun's path across the sky. Its inspired by the seasonal variations.

The user can see where the sun is in the sky. Both direction (azimuth) and height above the horizon. After the sun has set, the direction of the sun is displayed along the watch perimeter.

There are settings for the color of the second hand and whether the date, battery-level or status-icons should be displayed. And settings for showing sunset/rise and solar noon as times.

## Usage

- **Sunrise**: The time in the morning when the upper edge of the Sun becomes visible above the horizon, marking the start of daylight hours.
- **Solar noon**: The moment during the day when the Sun is at its highest point in the sky, directly above the observer's meridian. It typically marks the midpoint between sunrise and sunset.
- **Sunset**: The time in the evening when the Sun dips below the horizon, marking the end of daylight hours.
- **Sun ephemeris**: A chart that describes the Sun's position (elevation, azimuth, declination) in the sky at specific times during the day.
- **Sun position**: Suns current location.
- **Date**: The current day.
- **Battery level**: The current charge level of a device's battery.
- **Phone notifications**: Alerts, messages, app notifications, texts, or reminders received on a mobile device.

## Example code for sun calculations
It seems that it is "leaflet" Agafonkin who is behind the suncalc code that is used almost everywhere to calculate sunrise, sunset, and the sun's path in the sky. These are some projects I've been looking at:

## Monkey C
- Forskjell på `import` / `using`: [Svar](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/monkey-c/monkey-types/)
    - `import` and `using` bring a module into your scoping level
    - `import` it will bring the module suffix and all classes in the module into the type namespace. This allows classes in a module to be accessed without the modul suffix, making for easier typing. Function invocations still require the module suffix pto be accessed.
    - The difference between import and using is subtle. `import` brings the module name and class names into the namespace, where `using` only brings the module name into the namespace. If you are using monkeytypes you should use import exclusively, as it will save you a lot of redundant module references. Finally, the as clause is only supported for using statements.
    - `using` works fine unless you want to use type checking/Monkey Types
- `module` er en mengde med class. Ingen obj eller arv.
- dato / tid i monkey-c: 
    - `Time`: The Time module provides functionality for dealing with times and dates.
    - `Moment`: A Moment is an immutable moment in time. Internally, Moment objects are stored as 32-bit integers representing the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC).
    - `LocalMoment`: It differs from Moment in that it also keeps time zone information in addition to the time. \
    [Bra eksempelkode](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Time/LocalMoment.html)
    - `Gregorian`: *Moment* based on the Gregorian calendar
    - `info()` or `utcInfo()`: contains all of the necessary information to represent a Gregorian date.
- [Storage](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/core-topics/properties-and-app-settings/)
    - only make calls that hit the file system as infrequently as possible as those calls are expensive
